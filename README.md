# Cheating-Analysis

This is a mini-project for a quantitative biology fellowship intended to be used as practice for data tidying and cleaning to facilitate further analysis. 
This analysis revolves around identifying a list of potential "cheaters" by looking at scores of individual participants in different rounds of the competition.

## Rules

The scores are of individuals who participated in a League competition with an honor system round as well as live championship rounds. Initially, performances of
participants must exceed a certain threshold for them to be eligible to compete in the live championship. Several methods to identify potential cheaters have
been listed; involving both parametric (z score and p value thresholding) testing as well as non-parametric (ranking) testing.
